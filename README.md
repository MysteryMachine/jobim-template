# jobim

A Leiningen template for [jobim](https://github.com/MysteryMachine/jobim).

## Usage

From the command line, run `lein new jobim-template YOURNAMEHERE`. Once your project
has been created, simply `cd` into it, and run `lein figwheel dev` to spin up a development
server. To compile to Javascript for use in websites, run `lein cljsbuild once min`, and take
the resultant show-min.js file generated by it, and include it in a website of your choice.
To see what it looks like locally, open the min.html page on your browser. That page will
also include everything that needs to be included on the page to ensure the slideshow is
running properly.
